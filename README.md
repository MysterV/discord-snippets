Small, modular CSS snippets to improve tiny bits of Discord app's appearance.
Designed to work with custom Discord clients' custom CSS loaders.

Feel free to incorporate them into a theme if you want, and later let me know so that I can check it out. ðŸ¥º


# Installation
In the settings, there should be an option called "Quick CSS" or "Custom CSS".
Once you open the custom CSS editor, you have these options:

#### 1. Pick a CSS snippet and copy its contents directly into the CSS editor, this option allows you to easily\*\* tweak the snippets' variables, e.g. animation delays
<br>

#### 2. Use a one-liner `@import`, which saves space and ensures you're always up-to-date, using the following format\*:  
```css
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysterV/discord-snippets/main/css/NAME.css");
```
\* replace `NAME.css` with the name of the snippet you want, e.g.
```css
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysterV/discord-snippets/main/css/auto-hide-sidebar.css");
```
<br>

#### 3. To import ***everything*** at once, use `all.css`:

```css
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysterV/discord-snippets/main/css/all.css");
```
<br>

\*\* If you choose to `@import`, you can still tweak the settings, by looking at the source-code, copying the part of a snippet which contains the `--variable` you want to tweak, and adding it to your CSS editor *after* the imported snippet, e.g.
```css
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysterV/discord-snippets/main/css/auto-hide-sidebar.css");
:root {
    --transition-delay: 2s;
}
```
